William,"  I have no problem making phone calls to the United States, which was one of my main reasons for signing up for Sonetel. I love the idea and the possibility to become more ""global"" by having a local number in the US being outside the country.<br/><br/>However, another big reason I got the service, and is possibly the most important, is so people can easily reach me no matter where I am. The problem is that in most cases, my phone never rings when someone tries to call me. People have told me they have not been able to reach me through my Sonetel number.<br/><br/>The only times the service has worked was when I was in ideal conditions. With good Wi-Fi and good cell service. Even in these ideal conditions, people have only been able to reach me half the time.<br/><br/>In order for me to give 5-Stars I would need this service to work more consistently.

Chopped Anay,"  Not so great.

robert wintz,"  Have three business phone numbers with Sonetal for several years and no problems.  Payment was made automatically from a Cap One Visa card.  In December 2017 Cap One had an internal problem and my charge for Nov was again made in Dec.  I protested the charge to Cap One and they reversed the charge but notified Sonetal of suspicious charge and Sonetal ""security"" system automatically ""suspended"" the account.  Now NO business Numbers work.  I have sent numerous emails to ""support"" and none of the replies are useful in getting the matter resolved.  I have call 1-855-766-3835 and after message and making a selection no one comes on the line.  Live chat comes up and I message and says ""no agent available"".  Is Sonetel still in business?  How do I get my phone numbers back because for right now I am out of business?

Sidharth Oommen,"  Getting to many calls from unknown numbers a day after i signed in. I get like 15 calls and many voice mails. What a bother. cancelled the renewal today<br/><br/>Edit: Jan 31st they reached out to me saying they can swap my number for a new number. So bumping from 1 star to 2
            "
Yeah,"  Forwards phone calls well. But they can't figure out how to forward texts to email.

Don Leake,"  I have great concerns about the customer service and security policy. I have been using a Sonetel number with consistent service for several months. Instead of adding the same amount of call credit for each call, for the first time in awhile I added more from my credit card, and this caused my credit card company's fraud analytics program to deem the transaction as ""suspicious"", and because of this, Sonetel has blocked all calls to and from my account even if I change my credit card until it hears from the credit card company. This is a particular concern from me as my credit card, from the UAE, does not have any functionality to call customer service to resolve fraud issues....all potential fraudulent transactions are simply paid by the customer per the cardholder agreement. Therefore, my problem is that I have distributed this number to several clients over the past several months only to have Sonetel block all transaction activity on my account, no matter what card I use, and their customer service support tells me there is nothing I can do about it, causing a major loss in business as I have to contact each client and let them know I have to change providers. As one would imagine, I'm considering legal action over this, given the damages that are likely to ensue.  <br/><br/>Be careful of Sonetel...they wlll get your business tied to a particular number and then block you from it due to what one imagines is a cryptic, non-sensical security policy managed my low-level technical support staff that don't have the authority to intervene in a common sense way.

Ohgranny Geurts,"  This company has multiplied its rates by 10 for our phone line here in Belgium without advising us. Since this number was our only fixed number toour customer we have been obliged to pay a lot of money to Sonetel to stay reachable. About 0.65 euro/minute to receive calls from customer. This is illegal and we will file an official claim to the IBPT.<br/><br/>One advice do not use this provider they will rob you.

Ahmet,"  Works like a charm
            "
Daniel,"  So, I had unwanted calls regularly but then the customer service staff helped me to solve my problem. They did the extra mile to keep me happy, this is what all companies must always do!
            "
Joe,"  Very friendly and responsive customer service - love the ability to customize the service had one small issue when a client emailed to tell me my phone service was not working - when I followed up I learned my account balance bottomed out had led to a suspension of service - was back in service immediately once I submitted a small payment - apparently I had been emailed notice but I missed it among other emails - I think an automated system that sends emails as balance declines would have avoided this problem.
            "
Harshita,"  I completely love this service... For the price you cannot beat it.
            "
Matt,"  The platform and service is great. The support kept asking me for more details after opening and paying for the service and made it really hard to get a simple telephone number to forward to my number due to their strict validation process. My bank would ask for less information than this company. A standard reply with a template from some person that was incapable of reasoning and explaining exactly what they needed to proceed to unfreeze my account. Perhaps I even emailed with a bot...
            "
Rajesh,"  Service is good
            "
Leah,"  I thought it would charge incoming calls as local call rate rather that mobile call rates
            "
Maria,"  All the calls I get is from soliciting, I do not blame Sonatel for this it is frustrating
